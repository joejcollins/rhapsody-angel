Generally, to prevent it fermenting and spoiling, honey should have a water content of 17-19\%.
The Honey (England) Regulations 2015 sets out various definitions of what can legally be classified as honey.
For instance, honey must have a moisture content of 20\% or less to be sold as honey;
bakers' honey lies between this and a maximum of 23\%.
The Regulations also specify moisture contents for honey derived from specific plants.
