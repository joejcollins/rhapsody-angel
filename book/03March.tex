\subsection{March: Early Feeding}

The most common reason for colony loss is starvation in March before enough feed is available.
Therefore provide feed anyway.
Allows raising of strong colony for queen raising and the early honey.
Feed early, once the bees show through on the candy,
assume that are in need of feeding.
