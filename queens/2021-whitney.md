## 2021 Queen Cell marked with black pin

2021-08-08 No signs of queen cells.  I added another frame of eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).  The others that I put in last week are just being raised normally.

2021-08-01 No signs of queen cells, maybe the one that was there emerged.  I added another frame of eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).  The others that I put in last week are just being raised normally.

2021-07-25 Put in in more eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).  There was no queen cells on the previous brood frame that we put in 2 days ago (it just looked like the cells had been sealed).  There were queen cells in the honey area along with a load of drone brood.  I removed two frames from the honey area which had drone brood on them.

2021-07-23 Drone laying in the honey supers.  There is a single queen cell on the brood frame marked with a black pin and a number of queen cells in the honey super.  Added a frame of eggs and open brood from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).

2021-07-17 No sign of a laying queen, honey in the brood chamber.  Added a frame of brood and eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html) with the intention of raising an emergency queen.

2021-07-14 No sign of a laying queen.

2021-06-12 Went through the brood box and culled the emergency cells.  There were about 20.  Left a single queen cell on the North side, bottom of frame 4 (counting from the South).

2021-06-05 Made up with 11 frames from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html) and removed Bethany to the side.
