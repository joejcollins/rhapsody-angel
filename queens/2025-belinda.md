## 2025 Marked Queen

2025-08-08 No eggs or brood, didn't see the queen.  There is only a small patch of brood.

2025-07-21 Saw the queen, eggs and brood.  A suspicious amount of back filling going on it the top brood box, but no signs of swarming.

2025-07-14 Saw the queen, eggs and brood.  Plenty of stores but none in the super that has all be eaten, I am guessing because of the drought there is no nectar.

2025-07-05 Saw eggs and brood, no signs of swarming.  Reduced the entrance because there are lots of wasps around.

2025-06-30 Upgraded to 10 x 10 frames.

2025-06-29 Didn't see the queen, but saw eggs and no signs of swarming.  They probably need a couple more brood frames and a super.

2025-06-21 Found the queen and marked her.  Eggs and larvae in all stages.  There is a naff frame on one end of the top box that needs replacing.

2025-06-13 Laying well but needs more space.  Put on another brood box bringing them up to 8 x 8 F.

2025-06-07 Laying queen with brood at all stages of development.

2025-05-30 Not doing anything with the super, not time to check for laying yet.

2025-05-06 Culled down to one queen cell on the south face of frame 5, marked with a blue pin.

2025-04-28 Frames with eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
