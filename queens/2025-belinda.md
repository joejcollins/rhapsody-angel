## 2025 Unmarked Queen

2025-06-13 Laying well but needs more space.  Put on another brood box bringing them up to 8 x 8 F.

2025-06-07 Laying queen with brood at all stages of development.

2025-05-30 Not doing anything with the super, not time to check for laying yet.

2025-05-06 Culled down to one queen cell on the south face of frame 5, marked with a blue pin.

2025-04-28 Frames with eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
