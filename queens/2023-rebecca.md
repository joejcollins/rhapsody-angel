## 2023 One Queen Cell

2023-05-21 Checked the supers, they have nectar in them and a few frame are sealed.  The undrawn frames that I added have not been drawn yet, so I decided not to put on the clearer boards but to wait until the beginning of June (this is the earliest that we have cleared supers in previous years).  The yellow oil seed rape pollen has stopped coming in, now they are bringing in light grey raspberry pollen.

2023-05-07 Culled down to one queen cell on the bottom in the middle of the 5th frame from the south.  Marked with a black pin.  Lots of bees so I added two supers.

2023-04-30 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html).
