## 2023 Queen (not marked)

2023-06-03 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen. Configured so they are now 10 on 10 with a dummy board in each brood box.  The upper brood box is only partially drawn so there is a lot of space there.  The two supers are medium weight but I don't think it is oil seed rape nectar so there is no hurry to get them off.

2023-06-08 Added a second brood box with a queenless swarm.  Did a sandwich unite with the 2 supers on top.

2023-06-04 Saw grubs and the queen, didn't mark her.  All looks good. Took off 2 supers, put a clearer board in to clear another one.

2023-06-04 Put on a clearer board to clear 3 supers, this doesn't leave much space to I put on another super, so there are 5 in total.

2023-05-21 Checked the supers, they have nectar in them and a few frame are sealed.  The undrawn frames that I added have not been drawn yet, so I decided not to put on the clearer boards but to wait until the beginning of June (this is the earliest that we have cleared supers in previous years).  The yellow oil seed rape pollen has stopped coming in, now they are bringing in light grey raspberry pollen.

2023-05-07 Culled down to one queen cell on the bottom in the middle of the 5th frame from the south.  Marked with a black pin.  Lots of bees so I added two supers.

2023-04-30 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html).
