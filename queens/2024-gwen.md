## 2024 Unmarked Queen

2024-06-14 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen.

2024-06-03 Took of a super.  Moisture content 18%.

2024-06-01 Put on a clearer board to clear one super.

2024-05-11 Culled down to one emergency cell on the furthest north frame marked with a blue pin.  I damaged a lot of the queen cells by moving the frames.  I should move to 10 frames and a dummy board.

2024-05-04 Created with brood frames from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html).
