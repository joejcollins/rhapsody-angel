## 2024 Unmarked Queen

2024-07-26 Saw eggs and grubs no sealed brood yet.  It is 20 days since I caught the swarm.  Saw the queen (she seemed a bit small) and marked her.

2024-07-19 They have drawn 4 or 5 frames, there are patches that look like they are waiting for laying but I saw no eggs.

2024-07-07 Swarm from [Gwendolyn]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gwendolyn.html).
