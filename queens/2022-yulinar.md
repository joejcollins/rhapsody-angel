## 2022 Queen Cell

2022-08-13 **Check for Laying Queen**

2022-07-13 The queen cell in the bottom box was torn open on the side.  But there was a queen cell in the top box, on the east side of the 3rd frame counting from the west, marked with an orange pin.  There was one other emergency cell which I took down.  There were no eggs and all the larvae I saw were segmented.  There aren't a lot of bees in the top box, so it is available if one of the other hives needs it.

2022-07-08 [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html) swarmed.  There were eggs in some of the cells but not many.  I guess it wasn't a supercedure like I had thought.  Went through the colony and culled all the queen cells leaving one, marked with an orange pin on the bottom of frame 4 from the north in the bottom box.  There were still a few eggs so I should probably go back a few days and check for emergency cells.
