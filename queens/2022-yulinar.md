## 2022 Queen Cell

2022-08-13 **Check for Laying Queen**

2022-07-13 **Cull Emergency Cells**

2022-07-08 [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html) swarmed.  There were eggs in some of the cells but not many.  I guess it wasn't a supercedure like I had thought.  Went through the colony and culled all the queen cells leaving one, marked with an orange pin on the bottom of frame 4 from the north in the bottom box.  There were still a few eggs so I should probably go back a few days and check for emergency cells.
