## 11 F + 5 S

## 2023 One Queen Cell

2023-06-04 Put on a clearer board to clear 2 supers, this doesn't leave much space to I put on another super, so there are 5 in total.

2023-05-07 Culled down to one queen cell on the bottom of the 5th frame from the south.  Marked with a green pin.  Lots of bees so I added two supers.

2023-04-29 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yasmin.html).
