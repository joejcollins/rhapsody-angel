## 2021 Marked Queen

2022-05-14 Very busy, back filling, some uncharged queen cups.  There were drones and a whole lot of brood to come out so I decided to do a preemptive split and made up [Yasmin]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yasmin.html) on the original site.

2022-05-05 Very busy, removed entrance block and added a super.  No signs of swarming.  Saw the queen, she looked fine.

2022-04-30 Plenty of bees and drones, no signs of swarming, some empty queen cups.

2022-04-24 Plenty of bees, put on another super.  There was a section of drone brood, about half a frame.  A few queen cups and there might have been a tiny bit of back filling.

2022-04-14 Half hearted inspection, we seemed to be breaking drone comb.  Lots of bees so I put on a super.

2022-03-26 Marked the queen.  Lots of bees, about 8 frames with brood on.  Half of one frame was drone brood.  A good balance of stores, but not enough for more than a week of bad weather in my opinion.

2021-12-20 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment), the bees were in the middle between the top and bottom brood boxes.  Put on a block of candy.

2021-09-17 Brood and grubs will assume that the queen is good.  Plenty of food.

2021-09-06 Took off the MAQS and started feeding again.

2021-08-30 Put the MAQS strips on between the two brood boxes.

2021-08-22 Added another brood box because I want to balance the flying bees with [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).

2021-08-20 Saw eggs and brood, still couldn't find the queen to mark her.

2021-08-09 Saw eggs and brood.

2021-08-01 Saw eggs and brood.  Added a couple more frames.

2021-07-26 Added two more drawn frames to give the queen more space to lay in.

2021-07-25 There was a bit of shit on the front of the hive so I thought they might have dysentery.  Saw eggs so probably has a laying queen.  No signs of dysentery.  They probably need feeding and a couple more frames.

2021-07-14 There was an additional emergency queen cell, so I culled it.

2021-07-11 I still think that there may be an emerged queen in here so I took out this sealed queen cell and put it in another location (beside [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html)).  I shook off one frame of bees and added another frame with minimal brood on it then added three frames with new foundation and a feeder.  The plan it is attempt to mate this queen in the event that the supposed emerged queen (designated [Winona]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winona.html)) isn't there or fails to mate.

2021-07-08 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).   One sealed queen cell on the top north face of the middle frame, marked with a blue pin.
