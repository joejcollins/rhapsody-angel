## 2021 Queen Unmarked

2021-08-09 Saw eggs and brood.

2021-08-01 Saw eggs and brood.  Added a couple more frames.

2021-07-26 Added two more drawn frames to give the queen more space to lay in.

2021-07-25 There was a bit of shit on the front of the hive so I thought they might have dysentery.  Saw eggs so probably has a laying queen.  No signs of dysentery.  They probably need feeding and a couple more frames.

2021-07-14 There was an additional emergency queen cell, so I culled it.

2021-07-11 I still think that there may be an emerged queen in here so I took out this sealed queen cell and put it in another location (beside [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html)).  I shook off one frame of bees and added another frame with minimal brood on it then added three frames with new foundation and a feeder.  The plan it is attempt to mate this queen in the event that the supposed emerged queen (designated [Winona]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winona.html)) isn't there or fails to mate.

2021-07-08 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).   One sealed queen cell on the top north face of the middle frame, marked with a blue pin.
