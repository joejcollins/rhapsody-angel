## 2024 Marked Queen

2024-07-26 Really only on two frames, but saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Saw the queen (brown and a good size) and marked her.  

2024-07-19 They had made comb between the end wall and dummy board, so I cleaned it out.  They are only on two frames.  I saw the queen looking large and brown.  But I had interfered enough so I didn't check if she was laying or not.
