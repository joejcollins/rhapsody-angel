## Emerged Queen

2021-07-14 Culled all the emergency queen cells, I am hoping the un-mated queen is still in there.

2021-07-08 Made up with 11 frames from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html) and removed to the side.  There was a clearly emerged queen cell despite the fact that I found the queen and there were eggs.  Also there were various other queen cells in a range of states.  I guess they might have been superceding and swarming at the same time.  Why not?  It would be a good summertime plan.  Anyway I am assuming that the queen is there so I will cull any queen cells in a week to ensure that no other queens can be raised.
