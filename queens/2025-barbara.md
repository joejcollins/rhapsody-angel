## 2025 Queenless

2025-06-08 Check for a laying queen.

2025-06-06 Probably queenless, no eggs or grubs.  The queen cell we left was broken open on the side.  I guess there is a chance that there was a cell we left but I think it unlikely.  Moved towards [Bobby]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2025-bobby.html) so that the bees can be merged with another colony, maybe [Belinda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2025-belinda.html).-regina.html)

2025-05-06 Culled to one queen cell on the bottom of frame 6 marked with a green pin.

2025-04-28 Frames with eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
