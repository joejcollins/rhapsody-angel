## 2022 Preemptive Split

2022-06-25 *Check for laying queen*.

2022-06-06 Remove the cleared supers, leaving them with three supers.

2022-06-04 Masses of bees despite the fact that they appeared to swarm on 2022-06-02.  Two of the supers are full so I put on an empty super and a clearer board to clear the full supers.  Didn't look in the brood chamber.

2022-05-21 Culled down to a single queen cell on the north side of frame 4 counting from the south.  Marked with a white pin.

2022-05-14 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html).
