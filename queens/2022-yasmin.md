## 2022 Marked Queen

2022-07-26 **Take off the cleared supers**

2022-07-23 Added 4 frames and put a clearer board on to clear the super.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen no signs of swarming. They don't appear to be working the super, with another 4 frames to make them into 10 x 10 they could be squeezed on to the brood boxes.

2022-07-16 Found and marked the queen.  There no signs of swarming but the single brood box was looking cramped, so we put them on double brood.

2022-07-12 Removed the cleared super.

2022-07-09 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen. I want to mark her.  One of the supers was heavy so I put on a clearer board.

2022-06-21 Saw eggs and brood, not sealed yet.  There weren't sufficient bees for the three supers so I'll feed in some bees from from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html).

2022-06-06 Remove the cleared supers, leaving them with three supers.

2022-06-04 Masses of bees despite the fact that they appeared to swarm on 2022-06-02.  Two of the supers are full so I put on an empty super and a clearer board to clear the full supers.  Didn't look in the brood chamber.

2022-05-21 Culled down to a single queen cell on the north side of frame 4 counting from the south.  Marked with a white pin.

2022-05-14 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html).
