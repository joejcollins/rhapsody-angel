## 2025 Queenless

2027-07-27 Check for laying queen.

2025-06-22 Culled down to one queen cell on the South face on the third frame from the North, marked with a blue pin.

2025-06-21 Can't find the queen, lots of back filling, 4 queen cells in the bottom box.  She might have flown yesterday or the day before.  Anyway there is not a lot of space so they need another 3 frames.  I can cull the cells down and put the frames in tomorrow.

2025-06-13 Saw eggs no signs of swarming, there are eggs in the top brood box now.  Left the feeder on.

2025-06-06 Didn't see the queen but there were eggs and plenty of brood.  Leave with the feeder on.

2025-05-30 They are not drawing the brood frames so I removed the super and put on a feeder.

2025-05-23 Still laying in the bottom box, they haven't draw the frames in th second brood box, but there are cells due to come out so soon there should be house bees to draw the frames.

2025-05-13 Saw the queen, brood and eggs.  Added another super because it is so warm and there are so many bees.  Could probably do with another brood box.

2025-05-02 Queen is laying so marked her yellow.

2025-04-30 Added more frames because they seem quite busy.  Saw the queen.
