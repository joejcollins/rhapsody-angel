## 2025 Marked Queen

2025-05-23 Still laying in the bottom box, they haven't draw the frames in th second brood box, but there are cells due to come out so soon there should be house bees to draw the frames.

2025-05-13 Saw the queen, brood and eggs.  Added another super because it is so warm and there are so many bees.  Could probably do with another brood box.

2025-05-02 Queen is laying so marked her yellow.

2025-04-30 Added more frames because they seem quite busy.  Saw the queen.

2025-04-28 Cast collected from the Batch.
