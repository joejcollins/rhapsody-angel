## 2025 Queenless

2025-06-08 Check for a laying queen.

2025-05-04 Culled queen cells.  Left one on the bottom of the cull frame marked with a white pin.  There aren't that many bees in there, maybe 3 seams of bees.  It could easily be just a nuc.

2025-04-28 Frames with queen cells and eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
