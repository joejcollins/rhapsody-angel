## 2025 Queenless

2025-06-08 Check for a laying queen.

2025-05-13 It seems all the bees have ended up in here so I swapped position with [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to give the old queen some more bees.  It might be too late because she should be on her mating flight around now.

2025-05-04 Culled queen cells.  Left one on the bottom of the cull frame marked with a white pin.  There aren't that many bees in there, maybe 3 seams of bees.  It could easily be just a nuc.

2025-04-28 Frames with queen cells and eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
