## 2025 Queenless

2025-06-15 Check for a laying queen.

2025-05-13 Added another super because it is so warm and there are so many bees.

2025-05-08 Culled down to one queen cell on the bottom of frame 6, marked with a red pin.

2025-05-02 Frames with queen cells and eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
