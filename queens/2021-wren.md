## Queen Cell

2021-09-04 Not so many bees so I took off a super and put a clearer on another super.  There are polished cells but no sign of eggs.

2021-08-20 Queen cells from  [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).  There are three queen cells near each other on a frame marked with a black pin (third from the North).  They look like they are about to pop.
