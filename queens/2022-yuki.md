## 2022 Marked Queen

Add one new frame.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen.  Could do with another frame to make them up to 11.

2022-07-16 Saw eggs and brood, looking fine still covering about 4 frames.

2022-07-08 Found the new queen and marked her.  They are covering about 4 frames.

2022-06-04 There are only enough bees to cover a couple of frames.  They seem pissed and are filling the cells with nectar, not preparing for a laying queen.  I am suspicious so we added a queen cell and some brood from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).  The queen cell is on the bottom of frame 6 (counting from the south) and marked with a black pin.  Check in 35 days.  Also added a feeder because it is such a small colony.

 Culled down to a single queen cell on the north side of frame 4 counting from the south.  Marked with a white pin.

2022-06-02 Swarm from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html).
