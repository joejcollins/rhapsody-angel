2022-07-09 *Check for laying queen*.

2022-06-04 There are only enough bees to cover a couple of frames.  They seem pissed and are filling the cells with nectar, not preparing for a laying queen.  I am suspicious so we added a queen cell and some brood from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).  The queen cell is on the bottom of frame 6 (counting from the south) and marked with a black pin.  Check in 35 days.  Also added a feeder because it is such a small colony.

 Culled down to a single queen cell on the north side of frame 4 counting from the south.  Marked with a white pin.
