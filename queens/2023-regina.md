## 2023 Unmarked Queen or No Queen

2024-08-11 ApiGuard and bucket feeder on.

2024-08-09 Put the clearer board on to clear the supers.  There is not much in the supers.

2024-08-02 There was a single queen cell at the bottom of the cull frame in the bottom box on the southern side.  Not other queen cells, there were a few eggs in some of the frames around the edges.  So I am not sure that they actually swarmed.  Superseding maybe?  Put on a clearer board to clear the most full super.  Also put in two extra brood frames so they had more space in the event that I clear down the supers.

2024-07-28 Saw a small swarm crossing the yard so I figured they had swarmed.  Went in and checked, didn't see the queen but I saw eggs and no queen cells so I guess is wasn't them.  Took off the cleared super and put an empty one on because they seem very busy and it is going to be a warm week.

2024-07-27 Didn't see the queen or do any checks because it looked like rain.  Put on a clearer board to clear one super.

2024-07-19 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen.  Lots of bees so I added two cull frames.  Now there are two cull frames one in the top and one in the bottom.

2024-07-14 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen.  Lots of bees. Lots of back filling going on.  The super is full so I added two more.  Also culled the drone comb.

2024-07-07 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen.  Some back filling going on. The super isn't full but is getting filled.  They probably need more space, both in the brood chamber and another super.

2024-06-25 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen. Put on a super to give them more space.

2024-06-19 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood, running out of space but the brood should come out soon.  No signs of swarming but there was a bit of backfilling going on.  I am going to take a chance and not split them.  Two or three of the frames in the top brood box are not drawn so I put on a feeder to help them out.

2024-06-01 Saw eggs and the queen, plenty of space.

2024-05-19 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There aren't too many bees and there is plenty of of space in the super.

2024-05-11 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

2024-05-04 No explicit signs of swarming, the weather has been cold and rainy.  However they are starting to backfill the brood chamber so I did a preemptive split and created [Gwen]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gwen.html).  I didn't get an opportunity to cull the drone cells so I will have to do that later.

2024-04-26 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen. Most of the cells on the drone cull frame are sealed. There were plenty of bees so I added a super.

2024-04-20 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen.  A few queen cups but no other signs of swarming.

2024-04-11 Very little stores.  About 11 frames of brood evenly distributed between the top and bottom boxes.  Found the queen and marked her (but not a round blob).  She is brown and looks a reasonable size.  There was plenty of brood and eggs and some drone cells.

2024-04-09 Candy all gone, put on a feeder with 1 to 1 syrup.

2023-12-21 Put on a candy block.

2023-09-23 Apiguard varroa treatment off.

2023-08-25 Second Apiguard varroa treatment.

2023-08-13 Started Apiguard treatment.

2023-08-12 Added another brood box and cleared the supers.  Confirmed that the brood is sealed as worker brood.

2023-08-09 Small patch of eggs, brood and sealed cells.  Eggs in bottom of cells.  It appears normal.  Too many bees to squeeze down into a single box.

2023-07-12 Culled down to one queen cell at top on south face of the second frame from the south.  Marked with and orange pin.

2023-07-04 Made up with 10 frames of brood from [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html).
