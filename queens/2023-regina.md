## 2023 Queen Unmarked

2024-04-20 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen.  A few queen cups but no other signs of swarming.

2024-04-11 Very little stores.  About 11 frames of brood evenly distributed between the top and bottom boxes.  Found the queen and marked her (but not a round blob).  She is brown and looks a reasonable size.  There was plenty of brood and eggs and some drone cells.

2024-04-09 Candy all gone, put on a feeder with 1 to 1 syrup.

2023-12-21 Put on a candy block.

2023-09-23 Apiguard varroa treatment off.

2023-08-25 Second Apiguard varroa treatment.

2023-08-13 Started Apiguard treatment.

2023-08-12 Added another brood box and cleared the supers.  Confirmed that the brood is sealed as worker brood.

2023-08-09 Small patch of eggs, brood and sealed cells.  Eggs in bottom of cells.  It appears normal.  Too many bees to squeeze down into a single box.

2023-07-12 Culled down to one queen cell at top on south face of the second frame from the south.  Marked with and orange pin.

2023-07-04 Made up with 10 frames of brood from [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html).
