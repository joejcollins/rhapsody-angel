## 2022 Marked Queen

2022-07-08 Lots of brood.  Found the new queen and marked her.  There is lots of brood and they are back filling so they need more space, another brood chamber I think. 

2022-06-17 Lots of bees on the front of the hive, appearing to be fanning.  Mating perhaps?  It was very warm.

2022-06-13 Removed the cleared supers.

2022-06-10 Put on a clearer board to clear the two heaviest supers.  The other supers are pretty light so they don't have a lot of stores.

2022-06-04 Culled down to a single queen cell on the bottom of frame 5 (counting from the south) marked with a white pin.  We checked all the frames and really couldn't see any queen cells.  It is 7 days since the queen was removed.  Perhaps we should be checking at 8 days?  Maybe but it is raining tomorrow so we can't.

2022-05-28 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).
