## 2022 Marked Queen

2023-07-09 

2023-07-04 Moved to a new position and added 9 undrawn brood frames so now there are 10 brood frames in the bottom and 9 on top.  I also shook in 6 frames of bees from the original site.  Since there are no supers I put on a feeder to help them draw the undrawn frames.  Left [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) in place with 10 frames to raise a new queen.

2023-07-01 Eggs, grubs didn't see the queen.  Some queen cups.  Too many bees.  Needs splitting so we can treat the bees in August.

2023-06-22 Only went through the top brood box.  Saw grubs, eggs and the queen.  There are some cups (one with egg an egg in it) but no other signs of swarming.  One of the supers was quite full so we put in on top ready to be cleared.

2023-06-16 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Remarked the queen yellow because the mark was wearing off.  She was looking into cells at the time checking out places to lay.  The supers all seem to be in use so put another one on.

2023-06-10 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Added 2 more brood frames so they are now 10 on 10 with a dummy board in each brood box.  One of the supers is pretty heavy and the one from yesterday is light (unsurprisingly).  An extra super wouldn't hurt, the weather is very warm and they still seem to be bringing in nectar.

2023-06-09 Added another super because they seem very busy.  Probably going to need more brood frames as well soon. 

2023-06-03 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen. About 14 of the 18 frames have brood on.  There is nectar coming in to the super but the outer frames don't have any nectar.  Nicely behaved.

2023-05-27 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen.  They are making drone cells and seem pushed for space to I added a super. 

2023-05-21 Saw grubs, eggs and the queen.  No signs of swarming but lots of bees and brood so I added 2 more frames.  Now on 9 x 9 F.

2023-05-18 Saw grubs and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Bees on all the frames, so I swapped the location to bleed off some bees and added 5 more brood frames.  Now on a 8 x 8 double brood.

2023-05-07 Saw grubs and eggs and the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Bees on 5 or 6 frames.

2023-04-30 Removed to one side on 11 frames and made up [Rebecca]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-rebecca.html) with most of the brood frames to raise a new queen.

2023-04-29 Queen cells with eggs in.

2023-04-19 Swapped position with [Yasmin]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yasmin.html) to balance the flying bees.

2023-04-15 There are 11 frames of brood, saw eggs, didn't see the queen.

2023-03-16 About a third of the candy is still there, never-the-less I put on a feeder.  Ominously quiet, but it is wet and about 10 C and the other hives were quiet too.  Didn't look inside.

2023-03-02 Half the candy still there.

2023-02-18 Most of the candy still there.

2023-01-02 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment) and candy block.

2022-09-18 Took off the Apiguard treatment.

2022-08-19 Second Apiguard treatment on.

2022-08-06 Started Apiguard treatment.

2022-07-26 Took off the cleared supers, added frames to bring them up to 11 x 11 and put on a feeder.

2022-07-24 Added two frames to make them up to 10 x 10.  Also put on the clearer board.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen no signs of swarming.  The new super frames are not being drawn.  They can probably be squeezed down into the brood with another two frames.  

2022-07-19 Removed a cleared super.

2022-07-16 Saw eggs, brood and the marked queen.  Two of the supers were heavy so I put a clearer board on to clear one.  The third super has undrawn frames so put this close to the brood chamber for them to draw out.

2022-07-12 Removed the cleared super, put another one on to replace it.

2022-07-09 The top super is pretty heavy so I put on a clearer board so I can extract it.

2022-07-08 Expanded the brood box to 9 x 9 frames.  The top super is getting heavier, so could come off soon.

2022-07-08 Lots of brood.  Found the new queen and marked her.  There is lots of brood and they are back filling so they need more space, another brood chamber I think. 

2022-06-17 Lots of bees on the front of the hive, appearing to be fanning.  Mating perhaps?  It was very warm.

2022-06-13 Removed the cleared supers.

2022-06-10 Put on a clearer board to clear the two heaviest supers.  The other supers are pretty light so they don't have a lot of stores.

2022-06-04 Culled down to a single queen cell on the bottom of frame 5 (counting from the south) marked with a white pin.  We checked all the frames and really couldn't see any queen cells.  It is 7 days since the queen was removed.  Perhaps we should be checking at 8 days?  Maybe but it is raining tomorrow so we can't.

2022-05-28 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).
