2022-07-09 *Check for laying queen*.

2022-06-17 Lots of bees on the front of the hive, appearing to be fanning.  Mating perhaps?  It was very warm.

2022-06-04 Culled down to a single queen cell on the bottom of frame 5 (counting from the south) marked with a white pin.  We checked all the frames and really couldn't see any queen cells.  It is 7 days since the queen was removed.  Perhaps we should be checking at 8 days?  Maybe but it is raining tomorrow so we can't.

2022-05-28 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).
